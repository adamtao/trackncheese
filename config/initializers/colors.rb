# These colors are used by the calendar plugin. I picked them somewhat randomly.
# Each one is used to group related tasks together so that all tasks for a given
# song, for example, are the same color.
#
# For consistency sake, the first two should match the primary and secondary colors
# from the foundation_and_overrides css file.
#
# Note: the first one is used for project-level tasks. The rest are each used in
# order for the project's song's tasks
